The installation script still working (just downloading the classic version) but will be adapted nevertheless. -- [Waterfox 2019.10 Release](https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-2019.10-release-download/).

# Waterfox Install for Linux

Waterfox download and installation script.
Tested on [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [POP!_OS](https://system76.com/pop), [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) and of course [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) 64bit versions.

### Some References

- The **waterfox.desktop** file is adapted from the one on [Arch Linux's AUR waterfox-bin.git](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/waterfox.desktop?h=waterfox-bin). Here is the raw/text only version: [waterfox.desktop raw](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/waterfox.desktop?h=waterfox-bin).
  - Changes:
  Added to the [waterfox.desktop](https://github.com/msmafra/waterfox-install/blob/master/waterfox.desktop) the [TryExec key](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html) entry at line `85: + TryExec=/usr/lib64/waterfox/waterfox`  with the full path of the application and also `88: Icon=waterfox-icon => Icon=/usr/lib64/waterfox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default256.png` altered the [Icon key](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html) by adding the full path for the 256px x 256px png icon. To point to the icon with the best quality.

- /usr/bin/waterfox file is adapted from Fedora's version of /usr/bin/firefox as a base, to do a quick adaptation. The file is installed by the DNF package manager during the installation of the Mozilla Firefox browser.
